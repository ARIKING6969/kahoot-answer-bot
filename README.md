# The Amazing Automatic Kahoot Bot (kbot)
People have made bots and things for kahoot in the past, but this is
a new and improved edition that actually does
everything for you. This one actually answers the questions, unlike
some other tools and spammers. 

## How does it work?

Intercepts and pretends to be a kahoot client. After receiving quiz name from host, looks up answers for quiz and uses them.

## Caveats

Does not work when:

+ Kahoot is private
+ Answers are randomized
+ Questions are randomized

  + Generally just a `brew install python3`
